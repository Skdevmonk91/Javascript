//Logical Operators
/*Operators is that look like given before sign to calculate the 
value(ex =,-,/,etc..)*/
/*Operands are the actually given value in question to give 
the answer("a=30,b=26" here 30,26 is operands and = is operator*/

//Logical And Operator
/*If both conditions are true then it can print true otherwise
it will print false(only applicable in logical and operator)*/
console.log(true && true);
console.log(true && false);
console.log(false && true);
console.log(false && false);

//Logical OR operator
/*If one of the condition is true it will print true otherwise
it will print false(only applicable in logical or operator)*/
console.log(true || true);
console.log(true || false);
console.log(false || true);
console.log(false || false);

//Logical not
/*It is used to print opposite of the text condition means if it has
value true than it will print false and if has false value than it
will print true(only applicable in logical not operator)*/
console.log(!false);
console.log(!true);
